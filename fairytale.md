Once upon a time there was a cat. It was a female but her name was Martin.
she found a male cat, a well dressed tom cat called Mike.
She found a male hedgehog named [ovuvuevuevue enyetuenwuevue ugbemugbem osas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfXFfNaMlu8).
Martin lived in a village called [Llanfair­pwllgwyngyll­gogery­chwyrn­drobwll­llan­tysilio­gogo­goch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llanfairpwllgwyngyll)
He has a habit of being so sharply dressed that he would shave his face with it. and collecting everyday flowers and balloons
The hedgehog and Cat became friends. then the hedgehog got ran over. 
The End

...and they lived happily ever after. <!--but what if they didnt?-->
